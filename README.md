# Chatbot
Got it 👍
Here’s a **README.md** file for **Task 2: FAQ Chatbot** that matches the style of the translator README:

---

# 🤖 FAQ Chatbot

A simple chatbot that answers frequently asked questions (FAQs). It uses **NLP preprocessing** and **cosine similarity** to find the most relevant answer to a user’s query.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Stores FAQs (questions & answers) in a dataset (dictionary/JSON).
* Preprocesses text (tokenization, lowercasing, cleaning).
* Uses **cosine similarity** to match user questions with the most similar FAQ.
* Returns the **best matching answer**.
* 🌐 Optional: Chat UI using **Gradio** for easy interaction.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
faq_chatbot/
│── chatbot.ipynb        # Main Colab notebook
│── faqs.json            # FAQ dataset (questions & answers)
│── README.md            # Documentation
```

---

## 🛠️ Installation

Run this in **Google Colab** (recommended) or locally:

```bash
pip install gradio scikit-learn nltk spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

### 1. Load FAQs

```python
faqs = {
    "What is your name?": "I am your FAQ chatbot 🤖",
    "How can I reset my password?": "Click on 'Forgot Password' and follow the instructions.",
    "How can I contact support?": "You can email support@example.com."
}
```

### 2. Ask a Question

```python
response = chatbot("How do I reset password?")
print(response)
# 👉 Output: "Click on 'Forgot Password' and follow the instructions."
```

### 3. Run with Gradio UI

```python
import gradio as gr

demo = gr.Interface(fn=chatbot, 
                    inputs="text", 
                    outputs="text", 
                    title="FAQ Chatbot")
demo.launch()
```

---

## ✅ Example Interaction

**You:** *Where do I reset password?*
**Bot:** *Click on 'Forgot Password' and follow the instructions.*

**You:** *How can I contact support?*
**Bot:** *You can email [support@example.com](mailto:support@example.com).*

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Add larger FAQ dataset.
* Use advanced NLP (Sentence Transformers, BERT).
* Deploy to cloud (Hugging Face Spaces / Streamlit Cloud).

Would you like me to **also write the full chatbot code (Colab-ready with cosine similarity + Gradio UI)** so you can link it in this README?
